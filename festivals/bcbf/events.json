We’re on the cusp of a technological transformation in multiple professional services industries. Our way of working and delivering services and products to existing and new clients is changing faster than we anticipate due to the burgeoning Age of AI and Robots fostering widespread automation of human tasks and roles. Robots are already said to perform better than some professionals on various tasks and buyer expectations and behaviours are shifting. Thousands of FinTech, RegTech, InsureTech, LegalTech \/ LawTech, PropTech and XYZtech startups have been registered around the world, and they promise to be better and faster than human professionals and their firms as we currently know them.<\/p>\n<p>So will AI really replace skilled professionals, manufacturing gurus or creative types? Or will it ride to the rescue, remove those thankless tasks everyone hates and make our lives better?<\/p>\n<p>In association with Talbots Law, Chrissie Lightfoot, multi award-winning thought leader on AI in the legal sector, challenges you to come and listen to this thought-provoking talk where she will share her knowledge, experience and insights on AI and Expertise Automation, what it will mean for professionals and businesses in all sectors and how can we prepare ourselves for the challenges and opportunities ahead.<\/p>\n<p>Chrissie aims to use the legal ecosystem perspective to suggest a winning model to help future-proof professionals, business people, entrepreneurs and their companies. Any human professional in any role in any size professional service firm (including clients!) or business of any kind looking for insight into how their business will need to bring humans and machines together, effectively, in order to compete and survive in the very near future, should attend this event!<\/p>\n<p>Chrissie will strive to provide a motivational, inspirational and even transformational (for some attendees) speech by providing insights which debunk the myths surrounding the theory of AI and in contrast brings a huge dose of reality in relation to the practice of AI now and in the likely near and distant future so that you can prepare and act now in HOW to future-proof yourself and your business.<\/p>\n<p>All attendees will also receive a free copy of Chrissie’s The Naked Lawyer Ebook.<\/p>\n<p>Agenda:<\/p>\n<p>2:00pm: Registration<\/p>\n<p>2:30pm: Presentation and Q&amp;A<\/p>\n<p>3:30pm: Networking<\/p>\n<p>4:00pm: Close<\/p>\n<p>Speaker:<\/p>\n<p>Chrissie Lightfoot – Legal Futurist, CEO EntrepreneurLawyer Limited and CEO Robot Lawyer LISA.<\/p>\n<p>Chrissie Lightfoot is one of the World’s Top Female Futurists.
