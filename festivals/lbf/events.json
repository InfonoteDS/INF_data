CSR is becoming increasingly important as a way for businesses to demonstrate they are engaging with wider social issues.  Embracing CSR has several benefits for businesses. These include being able to attract talented employees and raising staff engagement. It also helps with team building because people enjoy getting involved with their local communities as it gives them pride and satisfaction.  It can also boost a businesses profile with positive PR and opportunities to create content for marketing on channels such as social media. CSR can also attract clients as it allows them to see if a company is aligned with their personal values.<\/p>\n<p>Our presenters are Stefan Fura from the Superbia Group and Emma Hallam from local charity Alex’s Wish. They will use a range of real-life examples taken from different sized businesses\/organisations whom they’ve has personally worked with.

This year, following the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic, Visit Britain forecasts a 49% decrease in domestic tourism expenditure which will impact on the viability of businesses and employment in the sector. There are also predictions that it will take until 2024 for international tourism to recover. Tourism is largely a seasonal business and the pandemic has impacted heavily on the peak months between Easter and October on which many businesses depend. Most UK tourism businesses are also SMEs with around 90% employing less than 25 people. The large number, diversity and small scale of businesses in the tourism industry makes the calculation of the impact of the pandemic on the sector more difficult. One thing is for certain however, businesses will have to adapt, diversify and embrace the new normal if they are to thrive. This event will enable tourism businesses to hear from industry leaders about their experiences and predictions to help rethink a future for local tourism and reset their plans. There will also be an opportunity to hear about initiatives that are being designed to help the visitor economy get back to its pre-Covid baseline.  <\/p>\n<p>This event is aimed at those involved in the management and marketing of local tourism businesses in both the leisure and business tourism sectors. These tourism sectors include sports, art and culture, heritage, indoor and outdoor visitor attractions, food and drink, hotels and other accommodation providers, conference centres, transport providers as well as the public sector and charitable trusts.  <\/p>\n<p>Attendees will gain valuable sector intelligence on emerging tourism trends and insights into future initiatives for the leisure and business tourism sectors to be delivered in Leicester and Leicestershire. This event also offers an opportunity to share ideas and learn from other tourism business leaders.<\/p>\n<p>Agenda: <\/p>\n<p>14:00 – Welcome and the visitor economy in 2020 – Pete Spriggs, Clearer Thinking<\/p>\n<p>Part 1- Reopen<\/p>\n<p>Twycross Zoo Reopens- A story of survival, resilience and innovation – Dr Sharon Redrobe OBE – CEO, Twycross Zoo<br>Manging a social business in a time of social distance– How hospitality businesses are surviving the pandemic -   Sam Hagger, Founder &amp; Director,  Beautiful Pubs Collective<\/p>\n<p>Part 2 – Recover<\/p>\n<p>Supporting Local Recovery – Place Marketing Team, Leicester &amp; Leicestershire<\/p>\n<p>Leicester &amp; Leicestershire Business Tourism Service– Samantha Hall, Business Tourism Manager<br>Uncover the Story – Local tourism campaign for 2021-  Susan Littlemore, Place Marketing Manager<\/p>\n<p>Part 3 - Reflect<\/p>\n<p>Reflecting on the new tourism landscape- Adapting to new consumer behaviour and future trends to ensure business survival – Visit Britain’s Future Trends Agency (TBC)<br>Reflections on the future for the hotel sector – James Conaghan, General Manager, Novotel &amp; Adagio Leicester<\/p>\n<p>Part 4 - Reset<\/p>\n<p>Reset for a better future <\/p>\n<p>Sustainable Tourism  and a Green Recovery- John Everitt - CEO National Forest Company<\/p>\n<p>Speakers: <\/p>\n<p>Pete Spriggs, Clearer Thinking<\/p>\n<p>Dr Sharon Redrobe OBE - CEO Twycross Zoo<\/p>\n<p>John Everitt - CEO National Forest Company<\/p>\n<p>Sam Hagger - Founder &amp; Director, The Beautiful Pubs Collective <\/p>\n<p>James Conaghan -  General Manager, Novotel &amp; Adagio Leicester<\/p>\n<p>Visit Britain’s Future Trends Agency (TBC)<\/p>\n<p>Samantha Hall - Business Tourism Manager, Place Marketing Team<\/p>\n<p>Susan Littlemore - Place Marketing Manager, Place Marketing Team<\/p>\n<p>Sally Coleman - Strategic Tourism Manager, Place Marketing Team<\/p>","longitude":0,"latest_end_local":"04 Nov 2020 16:00:00","earliest_end_local":"04 Nov 2020 16:00:00","hashtag_text":"","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"04 Nov 2020 16:00:00","venue_postal_code":"","venue_country_code":"GBR","performances":[],"categories":[{"name":"Location","options":[{"name":"Digital Event"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Retail, Tourism & Hospitality"}]},{"name":"Featured Event","options":[{"name":"Featured Event"}]},{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"04\/11\/2020"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"04 Nov 2020 18:00:00","slug":"bringing-the-worlds-of-schools-and-business-together","venue_name":"Leicestershire County Cricket Club","venue_city":"Leicester","latest_end_utc":"04 Nov 2020 21:30:00","earliest_start_local":"04 Nov 2020 18:00:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2020.ticketleap.com\/bringing-the-worlds-of-schools-and-business-together\/dates\/Nov-04-2020_at_0600PM","venue_street":"Fischer County Ground, Grace Road","latest_start_local":"04 Nov 2020 18:00:00","venue_region_name":"","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/df133754-2f3f-4519-850c-f9aaf57427ff\/hero.jpg","latitude":0,"latest_start_utc":"04 Nov 2020 18:00:00","performance_count":1,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/df133754-2f3f-4519-850c-f9aaf57427ff\/full.jpg","name":"Bringing the Worlds of Schools and Business Together","id":"855076e6-e910-11ea-b13c-22000b9ba0ca","html_description":"<p>This event provides an opportunity for schools and businesses to discuss how they can work collaboratively to provide mutual benefit for schools, students and business.  Schools, Colleges and Universities are a key source of fresh talent into organisations. However, the worlds of business and education do not always understand each other and this often leads to wasted, or at least delayed, opportunities for organisations and students. <\/p>\n<p>This event will highlight some of the benefits of collaborative working, whilst also encouraging shared learning and new partnerships between schools and business.<\/p>\n<p>Benefits for schools and students include increasing readiness for employment and accessing expertise. This could be through bringing potential employers into the classroom to supplement the curriculum and highlight possible career paths to students.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses benefit by helping to bridge the skills gap and by gaining access to a talented and enthusiastic group of individuals keen to access the workplace. By investing time into the partnership, organisations are able to get to know students and develop skills before a more formal interview process, meaning that they are better equipped to select the best upcoming talent.<\/p>\n<p>The event will include a three-course meal and is suitable for Head Teachers, Principals, Academy CEOs and Business Leaders.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will attendees gain?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An understanding of each other's worlds via connections and eventually a strategy for bringing students into industry via connections built and developed during and after this event.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Please note spaces are limited to 20 and attendance is by invite only - if you would like to attend please contact Ian Guyler at ianguyler@pedigreefilbert.co.uk or on 07973 693 455.<\/strong><\/p>","longitude":0,"latest_end_local":"04 Nov 2020 21:30:00","earliest_end_local":"04 Nov 2020 21:30:00","hashtag_text":"","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"04 Nov 2020 21:30:00","venue_postal_code":"LE2 8EB","venue_country_code":"GBR","performances":[],"categories":[{"name":"Location","options":[{"name":"Leicester"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Education & Skills"}]},{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"04\/11\/2020"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"04 Nov 2020 18:00:00","slug":"leicester-pre-start-ups-pitch-session-in-partnership-with-unive","venue_name":"Private","venue_city":"","latest_end_utc":"04 Nov 2020 19:30:00","earliest_start_local":"04 Nov 2020 18:00:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2020.ticketleap.com\/leicester-pre-start-ups-pitch-session-in-partnership-with-unive\/dates\/Nov-04-2020_at_0600PM","venue_street":"","latest_start_local":"04 Nov 2020 18:00:00","venue_region_name":"","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/51fa7039-fd71-430a-a698-776ee19008e1\/hero.jpg","latitude":0,"latest_start_utc":"04 Nov 2020 18:00:00","performance_count":1,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/51fa7039-fd71-430a-a698-776ee19008e1\/full.jpg","name":"Leicester Startups Pitch Event","id":"2442f4b8-f1c7-11ea-8e3f-22000b954370","html_description":"<p>Join us on the 4th November for Leicester Start-ups Pitch Event.

The event is aimed at all Leicestershire businesses, whether service-based or manufacturing.  <\/p>\n<p>Attendees will gain practical advice about flat hierarchies and organisational structures and processes to reward innovation, the agile timescale for funding (how to fund innovation without external finance) and developing innovation, and mindsets for employees and managers to achieve this.   <\/p>\n<p>Agenda:<\/p>\n<p>Head-to-Head with Innovation: Stuart Hetherington, CEO Holovis, The Innovation Mindset<\/p>\n<p>16.00 - Welcome and Introduction<\/p>\n<p>16.00 -17.00 - Rachel Granger interviews Stuart Hetherington<\/p>\n<p>17.00 - 17.30 - Questions from the audience<\/p>\n<p>Speakers: <\/p>\n<p>Rachel Granger - De Montfort University<\/p>\n<p>Stuart Hetherington - Holovis<\/p>\n<p>Carl Quinn - Innohouse<\/p>","longitude":0,"latest_end_local":"05 Nov 2020 18:30:00","earliest_end_local":"05 Nov 2020 18:30:00","hashtag_text":"","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"05 Nov 2020 18:30:00","venue_postal_code":"","venue_country_code":"GBR","performances":[],"categories":[{"name":"Location","options":[{"name":"Digital Event"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Business Support"}]},{"name":"Featured Event","options":[{"name":"Featured Event"}]},{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"05\/11\/2020"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"05 Nov 2020 17:30:00","slug":"black-owned-leicester-connect","venue_name":"LCB Depot","venue_city":"Leicester","latest_end_utc":"05 Nov 2020 19:30:00","earliest_start_local":"05 Nov 2020 17:30:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2020.ticketleap.com\/black-owned-leicester-connect\/dates\/Nov-05-2020_at_0530PM","venue_street":"31 Rutland Street","latest_start_local":"05 Nov 2020 17:30:00","venue_region_name":"","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/93e9751a-67d7-4962-91c9-8255863fb506\/hero.jpg","latitude":0,"latest_start_utc":"05 Nov 2020 17:30:00","performance_count":1,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/93e9751a-67d7-4962-91c9-8255863fb506\/full.jpg","name":"Black Owned Leicester Connect","id":"5bac3980-f1bf-11ea-9a70-22000b76a077","html_description":"<p>Connect with black business owners and entrepreneurs in or near Leicester!  This event is hosted by a member of the Black Owned Leicester Team.

Following the recent publication of the Ernst &amp; Young (EY) Global Integrity Report, EY claimed the pandemic will lead, optimistically, to improved business ethics. Looking deeper into the data, EY found that – actually – only 21 per cent of junior employees appeared to agree, whilst the majority (53 per cent) of junior employees were not confident that their management abides by relevant laws, codes of conduct and industry regulations. In addition, 13 per cent of EY’s respondents were prepared to ignore irresponsible business conduct to boost their own career or pay, with the figure rising to 20 per cent among directors. These discrepancies, we will discuss, are likely subtle signals of more dangerous problems lurking which may jeopardise the performance, and even survival of firms in a post-pandemic world. But is social, environmental and economic uncertainty really the new normal? Or did the crisis ‘wake up’ stakeholders to the issues underlying the business reality?<\/p>\n<p>This webinar is aimed at anyone interested in ethical and unethical business practice. Hear from a panel of business and academic leaders on what socially (ir)responsible business is in a post-pandemic world. With emotions running high and risks seemingly lurking around every corner, those people who are interested in the question; “what will the implications of “the new normal” be for socially responsible business practice?” - should find our discussion most stimulating.<\/p>\n<p>Our hope is that by engaging with the discussion on corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility, our participants will gain a better understanding of the risk and opportunities that societal expectations represent to their business, industry or sector - as well as those within their supply chains and beyond. As such, we are hoping for a very lively set of discussions indeed.<\/p>\n<p>Agenda: <\/p>\n<ul><li>Panel Discussion with ongoing fielding of questions from the audience – 1 hour, 30 minutes<\/li><li>Dedicated Q&amp;A at the end – 15 minutes<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Speakers: <\/p>\n<ul><li>Professor Mathew (Mat) Hughes, Loughborough School of Business and Economics (UK) - Moderator<\/li><li>Doctor Giulio Nardella, Loughborough School of Business and Economics (UK)<\/li><li>Doctor Irina Surdu, Warwick Business School (UK)<\/li><li>Doctor Anna Grosman, Loughborough University London (UK)<\/li><li>Ian McKellar, Chair of LATi (UK)<\/li><li>Romy Kenyon, EMEA Sustainability Manager at 3M (UK)<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Invited speakers: Janis Tse, Global Marketing Director at Plaza Premium Group (Hong Kong)<\/p>","longitude":0,"latest_end_local":"06 Nov 2020 12:00:00","earliest_end_local":"06 Nov 2020 12:00:00","hashtag_text":"","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"06 Nov 2020 12:00:00","venue_postal_code":"","venue_country_code":"GBR","performances":[],"categories":[{"name":"Location","options":[{"name":"Digital Event"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Business Support"}]},{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"06\/11\/2020"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"06 Nov 2020 11:00:00","slug":"engage-with-your-local-online-audience","venue_name":"Private","venue_city":"","latest_end_utc":"06 Nov 2020 12:30:00","earliest_start_local":"06 Nov 2020 11:00:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2020.ticketleap.com\/engage-with-your-local-online-audience\/dates\/Nov-06-2020_at_1100AM","venue_street":"","latest_start_local":"06 Nov 2020 11:00:00","venue_region_name":"","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/757da357-b53a-44f1-9bec-1eb965b52405\/hero.jpg","latitude":0,"latest_start_utc":"06 Nov 2020 11:00:00","performance_count":1,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/757da357-b53a-44f1-9bec-1eb965b52405\/full.jpg","name":"Engage with Your Local Online Audience","id":"80c42b52-e93a-11ea-b23f-22000a959115","html_description":"<p>How to engage and interact with your customers online, using social media and cost effective video content. The Power of Digital Video Marketing at affordable prices and how to create it.

This system has been responsible for climate change, biodiversity loss, natural resource degradation, ethical issues, poverty, excess waste generation, inefficient energy use, and increased the vulnerability of many developing communities in which these globalised products are manufactured. Measures must be taken to reduce these polluting and unethical practices that negatively impact on environment and society, and to work towards sustainable production and consumption.<\/p>\n<p>Slow design driven innovation is a potential solution to this problem. Slow design aims at reducing the exploitation of natural and human resources, celebrating their value, and increasing the lifespans of products based on quality and local traditions, in addition to outlining a model of alternative responsible consumption which confronts the current paradigm of \"more and cheaper is better\".<\/p>\n<p>The event involves presentation from academics (University of Leicester’s School of Business), Leicester-based businesses (Fullalove Clothing), the introduction to a toolkit, and the launch of a digital exhibition of artists interpreting these issues.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the experience, at registration attendees will also have an opportunity to sign up to participate in an interactive ‘game’ . signed up participants will be teamed up with another participant, each day, toreceive a slow innovation and sustainability related question to discuss together for 15 min via wazzup, chat or phone, their preference.

Businesses have been forced to adapt to a period of extreme uncertainty and disruption, not least on supply chains. The economic consequences of the pandemic on supply chains will be long lasting and perhaps accelerate a shift in economic structures that have defined the modern financial world. De-globalisation and onshoring might replace the reliance on foreign supply chains. The management of supply chains demands careful attention to ensure the business can remain operational and to avoid contractual breaches and financial loss. This event will look at the impact of Covid on supply chains from an economic and legal perspective. It will discuss de-globalisation and onshoring and how risks can be identified and managed. The event is aimed at small and medium size businesses who access goods or services which are delivered as part of a global supply chain.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will attendees gain?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Improved understanding of risks facing supply chains and how these may be managed along with an explanation of the economics that support such distribution.<\/p>\n<p>The information will be especially useful for businesses who have to plan to trade through the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Agenda:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>TBC<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speakers: <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul><li>Janet Mui - Investment Director Brewin Dolphin<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Janet is investment director at Brewin Dolphin.

So why take the risk?<\/p>\n<p>The objective of the masterclass is to discuss how the City’s and County’s businesses can actually grow using external finance and dispel some of the myths about securing loan funding and raising equity investment.  <\/p>\n<p>The masterclass will be promoted to Leicester and Leicestershire businesses that are looking to grow but realise that they can only do so by using external finance.

energy levels, all so important in ths stressful world in which we live and work. We will inform and show in this workshop how this ancient practice of Qi Gong, a moving meditation and “moving medication” can help you and your work force to stay healthy either at home or in the office. <\/p>\n<p>This is a Zoom based workshop, an introduction to the easy to learn system of energy enhancing exercises.<\/p>\n<p>Qigong coordinates movement with breathing and inner concentration. If practiced regularly, it will give you more energy, improve your health and help prevent illness.<\/p>\n<p>The primary aim of practicing Qigong is to gently build and regulate your vitality by enhancing your Qi.<\/p>\n<p>Research indicates that Qigong relaxes the muscles and the nervous system (so improving the function of the body's systems) and benefits posture, balance and flexibility of joints.<\/p>\n<p>Qi is quite simply, the Chinese name for \"life force\". Gong is the Chinese name for \"work\" or \"training\". Qigong therefore means working with the life force.<\/p>\n<p>In this Zoom session, for reasons of calm and privacy I will mute all attendees microphones and restrict their cameras so only the instructor will be seen and heard. There will however be a question and answer session at the end of the workshop where I will un-mute all microphones.<\/p>\n<p>The event is aimed at individuals and employers who want to improve their own health and wellbeing and that of their employees by introducing themselves to the benefits of the practice. <\/p>\n<p>Attendees will be introduced to the basics of breathing and movements of Qi Gong, giving them an understanding of the energy enhancing exercises that if practiced regularly will give them more energy, improve their health and prevent illness.<\/p>\n<p>Agenda: <\/p>\n<ul><li>Introduction<\/li><li>Qi Gong sequence<\/li><li>Warm down<\/li><li>Q&amp;As<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Instructor - Duncan Passmore<\/p>","longitude":0,"latest_end_local":"12 Nov 2020 11:30:00","earliest_end_local":"12 Nov 2020 11:30:00","hashtag_text":"","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"12 Nov 2020 11:30:00","venue_postal_code":"","venue_country_code":"GBR","performances":[],"categories":[{"name":"Location","options":[{"name":"Digital Event"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Sport & Health"}]},{"name":"Featured Event","options":[{"name":"Featured Event"}]},{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"12\/11\/2020"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"12 Nov 2020 10:30:00","slug":"accessibility-for-all-session-2","venue_name":"Private","venue_city":"","latest_end_utc":"12 Nov 2020 12:30:00","earliest_start_local":"12 Nov 2020 10:30:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2020.ticketleap.com\/accessibility-for-all-session-2\/dates\/Nov-12-2020_at_1030AM","venue_street":"","latest_start_local":"12 Nov 2020 10:30:00","venue_region_name":"","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/37f7ab2b-8d7c-4179-b5a5-b7703189b518\/hero.jpg","latitude":0,"latest_start_utc":"12 Nov 2020 10:30:00","performance_count":1,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/37f7ab2b-8d7c-4179-b5a5-b7703189b518\/full.jpg","name":"The New Normal – How to Provide Opportunities for People with Sight Loss to Gain Access to the Professional Services They Need","id":"55cb3d0a-0244-11eb-b310-22000ab790de","html_description":"<p>Picture yourself during lockdown, you were told to keep at least two metres apart, not to touch anything and wear a face mask and gloves.  Now, imagine for a moment that you are blind or severely sight impaired, even worse, deaf blind.  You feel your way around, lipread and can only venture out if you have a guide – how on earth are you going to cope and access essential services?
