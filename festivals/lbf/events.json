Disputes can occur for a variety of reasons, common disputes include landlord and tenant issues, an issue with a contract or a business not delivering as promised. Resolving disputes can be stressful, time consuming, extremely costly and ultimately take your focus away from your business.<\/p>\n<p>Commercial mediation is a great alternative to the usual litigation route and allows disputes between businesses or between businesses and their customers to be solved quickly and cost-effectively, without the need for court proceedings. This event, delivered by commercial mediator Tim Bennett, will explore the benefits of mediation and how the mediation process works.<\/p>\n<p>The event is aimed at business owners and managers. Any business can be subject to a dispute. Knowing how to resolve these disputes quickly is the key to ensuring they don't impact the business and costs don't escalate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Confirmed Speaker<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tim Bennett, is an experienced solicitor and accredited mediator.

However, the worlds of business and education do not always understand each other and this often leads to wasted, or at least delayed, opportunities for organisations and students. <\/p>\n<p>This event will highlight some of the benefits of collaborative working, whilst also encouraging shared learning and new partnerships between schools and business.<\/p>\n<p>Benefits for schools and students include increasing readiness for employment and accessing expertise. This could be through bringing potential employers into the classroom to supplement the curriculum and highlight possible career paths to students.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses benefit by helping to bridge the skills gap and by gaining access to a talented and enthusiastic group of individuals keen to access the workplace. By investing time into the partnership, organisations are able to get to know students and develop skills before a more formal interview process, meaning that they are better equipped to select the best upcoming talent.<\/p>\n<p>The event will include a three-course meal and is suitable for Head Teachers, Principals, Academy CEOs and Business Leaders.

Each sandpit is led by a director of the *Tiger Team that helps to outline the problem and facilitates discussions. The process is broken down into:<\/p>\n<p>• Defining the scope of the issue<\/p>\n<p>• Sharing an understanding of the problem<\/p>\n<p>• Using creative and innovative thinking techniques to focus on a problem<\/p>\n<p>• Potentially turning Sandpit outputs into a project to be supported by a Tiger Team<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><strong>How does the *Tiger Team support the Sandpit?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After the Sandpit session, the company has the opportunity to request a *Tiger Team to be formed to progress one or more of the solutions identified collectively over a period of time. The Tiger Team is made up of highly skilled, hand-picked groups of people who are tenacious about problem solving through research and innovation.<\/p>\n<p>The Leicester Innovation Hub team ensures that the Tiger Team are highly multidisciplinary mix of participants, some active researchers and others potential users of research outcomes, to drive lateral thinking and radical approaches to address innovation and research challenges. LEAN Innovation Tiger Teams at University of Leicester deliver an interactive 2-3 hour sessions involving 5-6 discipline academic experts and business innovation support providers and one SME director (and other key personnel within the business). They are a high-functioning team of specialists who come together to complete a specific project.<\/p>\n<p>Participants must have the ability to collaborate, share ideas openly and solve problems together so they maximize the combined power of their skills. Tiger Teams work best for companies that are interested in open innovation by bringing together people who would not normally interact to inspire creative thinking to address business needs to help create business impact and value for all involved.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the main benefits of the Sandpits?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The benefits of the ‘sandpits’ are many and varied. It brings opportunities for knowledge sharing and generating ideas. Perhaps most excitingly these events can identify areas where a business and the University can work together on a business challenge. These sessions have been organised to provide an opportunity for businesses to take part in and become familiar with a ‘sandpit’ event as a forum, where you can share some of your business challenges, experiences and ideas with some ‘great minds’. The University, in turn, can tell you about their experiences, not only in academic circles but also in the real world.<\/p>\n<p>You will be encouraged to challenge what has gone before; working across academic boundaries to discover solutions in the world of emerging social, economic and political change and challenges.

Each sandpit is led by a director of the *Tiger Team that helps to outline the problem and facilitates discussions. The process is broken down into:<\/p>\n<p>• Defining the scope of the issue<\/p>\n<p>• Sharing an understanding of the problem<\/p>\n<p>• Using creative and innovative thinking techniques to focus on a problem<\/p>\n<p>• Potentially turning Sandpit outputs into a project to be supported by a Tiger Team<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><strong>How does the *Tiger Team support the Sandpit?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After the Sandpit session, the company has the opportunity to request a *Tiger Team to be formed to progress one or more of the solutions identified collectively over a period of time. The Tiger Team is made up of highly skilled, hand-picked groups of people who are tenacious about problem solving through research and innovation.<\/p>\n<p>The Leicester Innovation Hub team ensures that the Tiger Team are highly multidisciplinary mix of participants, some active researchers and others potential users of research outcomes, to drive lateral thinking and radical approaches to address innovation and research challenges. LEAN Innovation Tiger Teams at University of Leicester deliver an interactive 2-3 hour sessions involving 5-6 discipline academic experts and business innovation support providers and one SME director (and other key personnel within the business). They are a high-functioning team of specialists who come together to complete a specific project.<\/p>\n<p>Participants must have the ability to collaborate, share ideas openly and solve problems together so they maximize the combined power of their skills. Tiger Teams work best for companies that are interested in open innovation by bringing together people who would not normally interact to inspire creative thinking to address business needs to help create business impact and value for all involved.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the main benefits of the Sandpits?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The benefits of the ‘sandpits’ are many and varied. It brings opportunities for knowledge sharing and generating ideas. Perhaps most excitingly these events can identify areas where a business and the University can work together on a business challenge. These sessions have been organised to provide an opportunity for businesses to take part in and become familiar with a ‘sandpit’ event as a forum, where you can share some of your business challenges, experiences and ideas with some ‘great minds’. The University, in turn, can tell you about their experiences, not only in academic circles but also in the real world.<\/p>\n<p>You will be encouraged to challenge what has gone before; working across academic boundaries to discover solutions in the world of emerging social, economic and political change and challenges. Using their knowledge, skills and contacts, our experts are well placed to help support you in growing your business through research funding and innovation.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","longitude":0,"latest_end_local":"07 Nov 2019 18:30:00","earliest_end_local":"05 Nov 2019 14:30:00","hashtag_text":"","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"05 Nov 2019 14:30:00","venue_postal_code":"LE1 7PA","venue_country_code":"GBR","performances":[],"categories":[{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"Thursday 7th November"},{"name":"Tuesday 5th November"},{"name":"Monday 4th November"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Business Support"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"05 Nov 2019 12:30:00","slug":"google-workflow-workshop---freedom-within-the-cloud","venue_name":"Currys PC","venue_city":"Leicester","latest_end_utc":"05 Nov 2019 16:30:00","earliest_start_local":"05 Nov 2019 12:30:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2019.ticketleap.com\/google-workflow-workshop---freedom-within-the-cloud\/dates\/Nov-05-2019_at_1230PM","venue_street":"Fosse Park South","latest_start_local":"05 Nov 2019 16:00:00","venue_region_name":"","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/7596a79e-12fc-4d28-9cfb-4b5852281d39\/hero.jpg","latitude":0,"latest_start_utc":"05 Nov 2019 16:00:00","performance_count":4,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/7596a79e-12fc-4d28-9cfb-4b5852281d39\/full.jpg","name":"Google Workflow Workshop - Freedom within the Cloud","id":"5cdef290-db89-11e9-874f-22000b99e40c","html_description":"<p>A range of three fantastic workshops delivered numerous times through the day focusing on Education, eco system within the office environment, productivity within business and workflow within the office.<\/p>\n<p>* Education\/classroom: A session focussing on the Google Classroom and the workflow of handing out assignments and managing the learning journey of students within the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Mission control for teacher and students, manage the classroom with ease benefits simplifying their student learning process by utilising google docs and other cloud based services as well as how to tie this together with google classroom within an educational environment.  Hand out, collect and mark assignments directly from the student. <\/p>\n<p>* Workflow within the office: A session focussing on GSuite and the benefits of working within the cloud<\/p>\n<p>Collaboration and productivity apps for business, utilising your enterprise email addresses to tie it all together in the cloud.

It kits staff out with a suite of industry-leading benefits to boost wellbeing and performance, and it takes on the paperwork-heavy admin (HR Law, Payroll, Pensions, etc.) that often bogs down time and resources; that way, employers are able to focus their energy on important matters like growth, profit, and service.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Confirmed Speaker<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Scott Read, Chief Executive Officer<\/p>","longitude":0,"latest_end_local":"05 Nov 2019 15:30:00","earliest_end_local":"05 Nov 2019 15:30:00","hashtag_text":"","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"05 Nov 2019 15:30:00","venue_postal_code":"LE1 1QH","venue_country_code":"GBR","performances":[],"categories":[{"name":"Featured Event","options":[{"name":"Featured Event"}]},{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"Tuesday 5th November"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Professional Services"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"05 Nov 2019 14:30:00","slug":"google-workflow-workshop---freedom-within-the-cloud","venue_name":"Currys PC","venue_city":"Leicester","latest_end_utc":"05 Nov 2019 16:30:00","earliest_start_local":"05 Nov 2019 14:30:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2019.ticketleap.com\/google-workflow-workshop---freedom-within-the-cloud\/dates\/Nov-05-2019_at_0230PM","venue_street":"Fosse Park South","latest_start_local":"05 Nov 2019 16:00:00","venue_region_name":"","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/7596a79e-12fc-4d28-9cfb-4b5852281d39\/hero.jpg","latitude":0,"latest_start_utc":"05 Nov 2019 16:00:00","performance_count":4,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/7596a79e-12fc-4d28-9cfb-4b5852281d39\/full.jpg","name":"Google Workflow Workshop - Freedom within the Cloud","id":"5cdef290-db89-11e9-874f-22000b99e40c","html_description":"<p>A range of three fantastic workshops delivered numerous times through the day focusing on Education, eco system within the office environment, productivity within business and workflow within the office.<\/p>\n<p>* Education\/classroom: A session focussing on the Google Classroom and the workflow of handing out assignments and managing the learning journey of students within the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Mission control for teacher and students, manage the classroom with ease benefits simplifying their student learning process by utilising google docs and other cloud based services as well as how to tie this together with google classroom within an educational environment.  Hand out, collect and mark assignments directly from the student. <\/p>\n<p>* Workflow within the office: A session focussing on GSuite and the benefits of working within the cloud<\/p>\n<p>Collaboration and productivity apps for business, utilising your enterprise email addresses to tie it all together in the cloud.

The focus will be on providing practical tools and methods that you can use. We shall also discuss a range of examples of behaviour change in action.<\/p>\n<p>Speakers include; Professor Edward Cartwright, who is an expert in behavioural economics and Director of the Institute for Applied Economics and Social Value; Anna Cartwright, who is an Associate Professor in Economics at Coventry University and will talk about a project with the Home Office applying behaviour change in cyber-security; Charlotte Brown, who is a consultant for The Behavioural Architects, a global insight, research and consultancy business.<\/p>\n<p>This event will be of interest to business, public policy and the third sector.

There can be a constant pull to be doing the ‘hot new thing’ and to feel pulled in a million directions at once. We’ve found that this process is a lot easier, in fact almost effortless when you’re crystal clear on what drives your customers.<\/p>\n<p>In this interactive workshop we’ll take you through the process of grouping and defining your different customer groups into ‘personas’. Persona development is the first step in developing a marketing strategy that supports your business goals and returns a positive return on investment for your marketing spend.<\/p>\n<p>In this workshop, we will work through the process of building up to 6 personas to be further refined and agreed with your team, then prioritise with the intention of building them into a marketing plan. We’ll help you understand the steps you’ll need to take to form into a marketing plan that is built around your customers to yield results.<\/p>\n<p>Attendees will leave with a clearer understanding of their customers and where best to focus marketing efforts. The resulting documentation can be returned to again and again – to build a marketing plan, deciding which channels to focus attention on, writing messages on marketing materials, deciding which campaigns to run, briefing marketing creatives and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Confirmed Speaker:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jessica Shailes, Ideal Marketing Company<\/p>","longitude":0,"latest_end_local":"06 Nov 2019 17:00:00","earliest_end_local":"06 Nov 2019 17:00:00","hashtag_text":"","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"06 Nov 2019 17:00:00","venue_postal_code":"LE1 5DB","venue_country_code":"GBR","performances":[],"categories":[{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"Wednesday 6th November"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Comms, Marketing & Creative"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"06 Nov 2019 14:00:00","slug":"how-the-latest-technology-can-be-used-to-make-buildings--assets","venue_name":"Leicester Castle Business School","venue_city":"Leicester","latest_end_utc":"06 Nov 2019 16:00:00","earliest_start_local":"06 Nov 2019 14:00:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2019.ticketleap.com\/how-the-latest-technology-can-be-used-to-make-buildings--assets\/dates\/Nov-06-2019_at_0200PM","venue_street":"Castle View","latest_start_local":"06 Nov 2019 14:00:00","venue_region_name":"","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/57e5ea6f-6243-4434-b059-fb9cffea8c46\/hero.jpg","latitude":0,"latest_start_utc":"06 Nov 2019 14:00:00","performance_count":1,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/57e5ea6f-6243-4434-b059-fb9cffea8c46\/full.jpg","name":"How the Latest Technology Can Be Used to Make Buildings & Assets More Accessible For All","id":"a94b379e-daf1-11e9-9f02-22000aefa1cc","html_description":"<p>During this panel discussion, we will talk to contractors and consultants specialising in architecture and sports and leisure project development about the use of technology to make schemes happen.<\/p>\n<p>Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with a panel of speakers with in depth knowledge on the use of technology in the construction industry and discuss what is required to make buildings accessible for all.<\/p>\n<p>The session with include an introduction to the panel and their area of domain expertise along with two-way conversation with attendees to discuss latest technologies and barriers that need to be overcome.<\/p>","longitude":0,"latest_end_local":"06 Nov 2019 16:00:00","earliest_end_local":"06 Nov 2019 16:00:00","hashtag_text":"","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"06 Nov 2019 16:00:00","venue_postal_code":"LE1 5WH","venue_country_code":"GBR","performances":[],"categories":[{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"Wednesday 6th November"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Property & Construction"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"06 Nov 2019 15:00:00","slug":"streamline-your-business-through-epos-technology","venue_name":"eatPOS Head Office","venue_city":"Leicester","latest_end_utc":"06 Nov 2019 17:00:00","earliest_start_local":"06 Nov 2019 15:00:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2019.ticketleap.com\/streamline-your-business-through-epos-technology\/dates\/Nov-06-2019_at_0300PM","venue_street":"4th Floor, 13 - 15 Belvoir Street","latest_start_local":"06 Nov 2019 15:00:00","venue_region_name":"","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/d82c3c63-562a-4aec-96bd-e285a395c79a\/hero.jpg","latitude":0,"latest_start_utc":"06 Nov 2019 15:00:00","performance_count":1,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/d82c3c63-562a-4aec-96bd-e285a395c79a\/full.jpg","name":"Streamline Your Business Through EPOS Technology","id":"77220162-d3ee-11e9-a406-22000b1e8060","html_description":"<p>Streamlining business operations is important to business success and an important part of business strategy.

Anicca and many more spoke and shared their knowledge on various topics from SEO, PR, Social Media, Search, Email Marketing &amp; The Future Of Digital Shopping. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","longitude":0,"latest_end_local":"07 Nov 2019 13:30:00","earliest_end_local":"07 Nov 2019 13:30:00","hashtag_text":"","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"07 Nov 2019 13:30:00","venue_postal_code":"LE4 0AA","venue_country_code":"GBR","performances":[],"categories":[{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"Thursday 7th November"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Comms, Marketing & Creative"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"07 Nov 2019 09:00:00","slug":"beyond-brand","venue_name":"RSM, Rivermead House","venue_city":"Leicester","latest_end_utc":"07 Nov 2019 12:30:00","earliest_start_local":"07 Nov 2019 09:00:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2019.ticketleap.com\/beyond-brand\/dates\/Nov-07-2019_at_0900AM","venue_street":"7 Lewis Court, Grove Park","latest_start_local":"07 Nov 2019 09:00:00","venue_region_name":"","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/973721c6-7b3a-4b9a-8507-8f7540732592\/hero.jpg","latitude":0,"latest_start_utc":"07 Nov 2019 09:00:00","performance_count":1,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/973721c6-7b3a-4b9a-8507-8f7540732592\/full.jpg","name":"Beyond Brand","id":"399199ea-c9a6-11e9-9d50-22000b330ada","html_description":"<p>Having a point of differentiation in today’s marketplace is really tough.

Each sandpit is led by a director of the *Tiger Team that helps to outline the problem and facilitates discussions. The process is broken down into:<\/p>\n<p>• Defining the scope of the issue<\/p>\n<p>• Sharing an understanding of the problem<\/p>\n<p>• Using creative and innovative thinking techniques to focus on a problem<\/p>\n<p>• Potentially turning Sandpit outputs into a project to be supported by a Tiger Team<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><strong>How does the *Tiger Team support the Sandpit?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After the Sandpit session, the company has the opportunity to request a *Tiger Team to be formed to progress one or more of the solutions identified collectively over a period of time. The Tiger Team is made up of highly skilled, hand-picked groups of people who are tenacious about problem solving through research and innovation.<\/p>\n<p>The Leicester Innovation Hub team ensures that the Tiger Team are highly multidisciplinary mix of participants, some active researchers and others potential users of research outcomes, to drive lateral thinking and radical approaches to address innovation and research challenges. LEAN Innovation Tiger Teams at University of Leicester deliver an interactive 2-3 hour sessions involving 5-6 discipline academic experts and business innovation support providers and one SME director (and other key personnel within the business). They are a high-functioning team of specialists who come together to complete a specific project.<\/p>\n<p>Participants must have the ability to collaborate, share ideas openly and solve problems together so they maximize the combined power of their skills. Tiger Teams work best for companies that are interested in open innovation by bringing together people who would not normally interact to inspire creative thinking to address business needs to help create business impact and value for all involved.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the main benefits of the Sandpits?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The benefits of the ‘sandpits’ are many and varied. It brings opportunities for knowledge sharing and generating ideas. Perhaps most excitingly these events can identify areas where a business and the University can work together on a business challenge. These sessions have been organised to provide an opportunity for businesses to take part in and become familiar with a ‘sandpit’ event as a forum, where you can share some of your business challenges, experiences and ideas with some ‘great minds’. The University, in turn, can tell you about their experiences, not only in academic circles but also in the real world.<\/p>\n<p>You will be encouraged to challenge what has gone before; working across academic boundaries to discover solutions in the world of emerging social, economic and political change and challenges.
