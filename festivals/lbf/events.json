The presentation will cover key developments and trends in the commercial property market over the last 12 months and identify key opportunities which are likely to provide the highest returns for investors.<\/p>\n<p>Detailed comparisons and hot-spot maps will provide insights into the demand and supply of commercial property within (and between) key urban areas in the East Midlands (including Leicester, Derby, Loughborough, Nottingham and Northampton).<\/p>\n<p>Attendees will gain a greater understanding of the Leicester and East Midlands commercial market. More specifically, individuals with a property sales and development background and interest will be able to use the information to understand local demand, supply and the availability of different sizes and types of property on the market.<\/p>\n<p>In previous years the event has been particularly useful to property developers, investors, agents and policymakers. Tech4i2’s analysis can also assist local authorities and other organisations to find areas where there is ‘under’ and ‘over’-supply of commercial accommodation in the East Midlands.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the main presentation, there will also be an opportunity for group discussions and questions.<\/p>\n<p>Tech4i2 has been working with commercial property developers, investors and public sector policymakers for more than 30 years. After three years of commercial property market data collection, and with the help of Leicester University, they have developed a robust methodology to identify whether there is insufficient small business premises and what type of premises should be developed to address gaps in market provision and to maximise returns at six digit postcode level.  The market analysis Tech4i2 provide is utilised by banks, investors, property developers and the public sector.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Confirmed Speakers:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Professor Paul Foley<\/p>\n<p>Momin Ahsraf from Tech4i2<\/p>","latest_end_local":"31 Oct 2019 15:00:00","earliest_end_local":"31 Oct 2019 15:00:00","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"31 Oct 2019 15:00:00","venue_country_code":"GBR","venue_postal_code":"LE4 5NU","categories":[{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"Thursday 31st October"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Property & Construction"},{"name":"Professional Services"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"01 Nov 2019 09:00:00","slug":"preparing-for-chinas-e-commerce-market","venue_city":"Leicester","venue_name":"Welford Road Stadium","latest_end_utc":"01 Nov 2019 12:00:00","earliest_start_local":"01 Nov 2019 09:00:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2019.ticketleap.com\/preparing-for-chinas-e-commerce-market\/dates\/Nov-01-2019_at_0900AM","venue_street":"Aylestone Road","latest_start_local":"01 Nov 2019 09:00:00","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/e9a688de-7644-4555-b1f2-2ddd3509a3d1\/hero.jpg","latest_start_utc":"01 Nov 2019 09:00:00","performance_count":1,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/e9a688de-7644-4555-b1f2-2ddd3509a3d1\/full.jpg","name":"Preparing for China's E-Commerce Market","id":"6a222bb8-ce58-11e9-bb8b-22000a8d29f3","html_description":"<p>The Chinese e-commerce market is the world’s largest global e-commerce market, and by sales value, is larger than all other global e-commerce markets combined.

The goal was to get Leicester on the map as one of the leading cities in the digital marketing industry by providing a social and networking group that agencies, providers of digital technology, freelancers or individuals who have a keen interest in online marketing could meet at on a monthly basis. It is a fun, informal and informative networking session, with a mixture of traditional meet and greets as well as presentations from industry experts on specific topics.<\/p>\n<p>The event quickly grew, and to meet the demands of the audience, Anicca set up the E-Commercial Conference towards the end of 2015, with the first one held at the Curve. 2016 saw a move to a bigger venue, The Marriott Hotel in Enderby, where the likes of Google, Bing, Whoop! Anicca and many more spoke and shared their knowledge on various topics from SEO, PR, Social Media, Search, Email Marketing &amp; The Future Of Digital Shopping. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","latest_end_local":"07 Nov 2019 13:30:00","earliest_end_local":"07 Nov 2019 13:30:00","venue_timezone":"Europe\/London","earliest_end_utc":"07 Nov 2019 13:30:00","venue_country_code":"GBR","venue_postal_code":"LE4 0AA","categories":[{"name":"Date","options":[{"name":"Thursday 7th November"}]},{"name":"Sectors","options":[{"name":"Comms, Marketing & Creative"}]}],"description":""},{"earliest_start_utc":"07 Nov 2019 09:00:00","slug":"the-art-of-deception-recognising--defeating-phishing--social-en","venue_city":"Leicester","venue_name":"Belmont Hotel","latest_end_utc":"07 Nov 2019 12:00:00","earliest_start_local":"07 Nov 2019 09:00:00","url":"https:\/\/lbf2019.ticketleap.com\/the-art-of-deception-recognising--defeating-phishing--social-en\/dates\/Nov-07-2019_at_0900AM","venue_street":"20 De Montfort Square","latest_start_local":"07 Nov 2019 09:00:00","hero_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/e2056967-36f6-4346-817c-b9201fc582f4\/hero.jpg","latest_start_utc":"07 Nov 2019 09:00:00","performance_count":1,"hero_small_image_url":"https:\/\/ticketleap-media-master.s3.amazonaws.com\/e2056967-36f6-4346-817c-b9201fc582f4\/full.jpg","name":"The Art of Deception: Recognising & Defeating Phishing & Social Engineering Attacks","id":"b1f5fe46-c422-11e9-8ba9-22000b2b83ea","html_description":"<p>Online attacks and security breaches are becoming increasingly common as the attackers become more and more sophisticated in their approach and the art of deception.<\/p>\n<p>This seminar will help you to spot various types of phishing and social engineering attacks on your business or organisation.
